Changes since v1:

- Gathered Reviewed-by tags.
- Various changes to commit messages and comments to hopefully make the code
easier to understand.
- Patches #3 ("s390: Do not use the physical allocator") and #9
("lib/alloc_phys: Expand documentation with usage and limitations") are new.
- Folded patch "arm: page.h: Add missing libcflat.h include" into #18
("arm/arm64: Perform dcache maintenance at boot").
- Reordered the series to group patches that touch aproximately the same code
together - the patches that change the physical allocator are now first,
followed come the patches that change how the secondaries are brought online.
- Fixed several nasty bugs where the r4 register was being clobbered in the arm
assembly.
- Unmap the early UART address if the DTB address does not match the early
address.
- Added dcache maintenance when a page table is modified with the MMU disabled.
- Moved the cache maintenance when disabling the MMU to be executed before the
MMU is disabled.
